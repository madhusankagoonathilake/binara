**binara** is a standalone CAPTCHA library for PHP, based on GD. This library is intended to be used in web applications which do not depend on internet based CAPTCHA service providers.

This library was named as **binara**, since it was started on 2011-09-11, which is the _Binara [Poya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poya) Day_ of the Buddhist calendar, for the year 2011.
